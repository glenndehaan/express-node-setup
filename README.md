# Express Node Setup

A basic setup for an NodeJS express server

## Structure
- NodeJS
- ES6
- NodeMon
- body-parser
- ejs
- express
- mongoose
- MongoDB

## Usage
I'm using Docker to run a dev version off the setup.

1. To start using this setup download the latest version of Docker.
2. Then run the build_docker.sh file and you are off to the races.
3. Open Kitematic to see the build progress.

Then open up your favorite web browser and go to: http://localhost:3001
That's it. Easy right?

## Tips
After the you setup docker. Try to do a post to http://localhost:3001/robots

With the following body `{name: 'test'}`

Then open up the browser again and go to: http://localhost:3001

Another tip: to do this 'post' try PostMan: https://www.getpostman.com/
